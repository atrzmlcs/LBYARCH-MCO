## Execution time and short analysis of the performance

The Assembly program was able to run faster compared to the C program, since it is similar to giving the computer direct step-by-step instructions that tell the CPU exactly what to do.
It has no extra steps, unlike a compiler.
The GCC Compiler not only translates it into machine instructions, but it also adds extra steps for safety, flexibility, and ease of use, such as checking for errors, managing memory, and handling function calls.
Even with optimizations, C includes overhead that assembly skips.
